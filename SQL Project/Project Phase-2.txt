-- Project Phase III
-- 1. Find how much amount spent by each customer on artists? Write a query to return customer name, artist name and total spent

-- 3. Write a query that determines the customer that has spent the most on music for each country. 
-- Write a query that returns the country along with the top customer and how much they spent. For countries
